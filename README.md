# Arm64ReactNative
Sample React Native Project with settings for ARM64 Chromebook

Works with ARM64 Chromebook and Android Build Tools for ARM

Build tools for ARM Linux have been included..

Apparently they are from here: https://github.com/skyleecm/android-build-tools-for-arm
but aleady built for this project.

This was the result of walking through this tutorial: https://shortfuse.org/2017/06/15/guide-developing-on-chromeos-part-1/

Enabling debug mode, reboot, ssh, and connecting to ADB debugger usually has to be done a few times for it to connect.
Usually, I toggle debug mode and repeat the process but you know it is ready when the Android debugger window pops up.
If at first you don't succeed try try again ;)
